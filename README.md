# Phoenix's Mod Pack for Life is Feudal

<br>

# What is it?
PMP is a collection of scripts from your Kindom Developer, GoodOldPhoenix! In this pack you will find:
+ GMGui - Interactive Controls in a UI for server GM's.
+ EasyKeyBinds - What it says on the box, creates keybinds for a few neat funcitons such as /stuck

For now, only GMGui is available as I am currently working on a Gui for the EasyKeyBinds mod which will be released shortly so there is no point in people getting v0.1 to only have to get v1.0 two hours later ;)

<br> 

# Planned/Future Features
+ Teleport Player to GM function
+ Auto Terrain Levelling

<br>

# Installation

1. Unpack the folder GMGui to "%GameDirectory%/scripts/"
2. Open the main.cs file located in your Root game directory and add the line "exec("scripts/GMGui/init.cs");" at the end of the file without the exterior quotation marks. 

All ready, press CTRL + G once leaded into server!
